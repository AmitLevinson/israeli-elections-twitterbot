# ElectionTwitterbot

A repo outlining setting up a twitter bot on a raspberry pi with a MariaDB to host the collected data.

As this is still a work on progress, in the meantime here's credit to two individauls which their resources were the stepping stones for this:  

- [Ran Bar Zik's tutorials for setting up a Raspberry pi](https://internet-israel.com/category/%D7%9E%D7%93%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9B%D7%99%D7%9D/raspberrypi/) Ran makes it very easy and accessible to setup a Raspberry Pi and worth following along if you're interested. Though it's in Hebrew, I'm sure you can find many other relevant tutorials.

- [Mike Mahoney's](https://www.mm218.dev/) GitHub repository containing the [R code for setting up a Twitter bot](https://github.com/mikemahoney218/retweet_bot). Mike's code is fantastic and worth reading even if you don't intend on openning up a Twitter bot. It required some adaptations to Hebrew but other than that it was perfect for setting up the whole process.
